# week-1-data-science-project
in this project, i wrote some python code to answer a few questions 
N/B stack overflow, google gemini and chat gpt came in very handy 


# Find all records where the weather was exactly clear

        here i first created my variable and defined it
        then printed the result 


# to find the number of times the wind speed was exactly 4km/h

    here i defined my variable and used the equal function to get the exact speed

# check if there are any null values in the dataset

          used the isnull function to get the null values and used the sum fuction to get the total number 

# rename the column weather to weather_conditions

          i defined my variable by replacing the weather co;imn with weather conditions and used a boolean to make               sure it was true then i had to change my first expression because it brought and error and had to rename it          to weather_conditions also, took me a few hours to figure this out


# getting the mean visibility of the dataset

          used the mean function to get the mean 

# wind speed greater than 24km/h and visibility is equal to 25
            defined the variable using the aggregate expressions

# mean value of each column for each weather condition
# Drop the 'Date/Time' column before calculating the mean

          this was kinda tricky ngl, spent 2 days thinking about it before asking for help, turns out the date/time             column was not an interger so i had to drop it first before calling my mean function

# Find all instances where the weather is clear and the relative humidity is greater than 50, or visibility is above 40

      used the aggregate functions to do this, ngl i could not find a good variable name 

#Find the number of weather conditions that include snow
      i achieved this by using stack overflow and gemini, i got stuck and almost gave up, but AI to the recue, right?
